Cybersecurity Compliance Audit & Risk Assessment

Project Summary

This project involved conducting a foundational security audit for a small business ("Botium Toys") to identify critical gaps in security controls and non-compliance with major regulatory frameworks. The goal was to assess the current security posture and provide actionable recommendations to reduce risk.

Part 1: Controls Assessment Checklist

This assessment identifies which foundational security controls are currently in place.

[X] FAILED CONTROLS (Not in Place):

Least Privilege

Disaster Recovery Plans

Password Policies

Separation of Duties

Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Manual Monitoring for Legacy Systems

Encryption

Password Management System

[✓] PASSED CONTROLS (In Place):

Firewall

Backups

Antivirus Software

Locks (Offices, Storefront, Warehouse)

Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)

Fire Detection/Prevention

Part 2: Compliance Assessment Checklist

This assessment identifies gaps in adherence to major compliance frameworks.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

[X] FAILED: Only authorized users have access to customers' credit card information.

[X] FAILED: Credit card information is stored, accepted, processed, and transmitted internally, in a secure environment.

[X] FAILED: Implement data encryption procedures to better secure credit card transaction touchpoints and data.

[X] FAILED: Adopt secure password management policies.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

[X] FAILED: E.U. customers' data is kept private/secured.

[✓] PASSED: There is a plan in place to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if their data is compromised/there is a breach.

[X] FAILED: Ensure data is properly classified and inventoried.

[✓] PASSED: Enforce privacy policies, procedures, and processes to properly document and maintain data.

System and Organizations Controls (SOC)

[X] FAILED: User access policies are established.

[X] FAILED: Sensitive data (PII/SPII) is confidential/private.

[✓] PASSED: Data integrity ensures the data is consistent, complete, accurate, and has been validated.

[X] FAILED: Data is available to individuals authorized to access it.

Part 3: Summary & Recommendations

All store assets are located in one building, which could be subject to a total loss from a physical or digital breach.

Immediate Recommendations to Stakeholders:

Separate Duties: Immediately revoke non-essential access to prevent insider threats.

Enforce Strong Passwords: Change all passwords to adhere to strong complexity guidelines.

Implement Principle of Least Privilege: Assign correct authorizations to ensure users only have access to the data absolutely necessary for their job.

Secure PII/SPII: As the company grows, it must secure sensitive data (PII/SPII) in a separate, managed location to avoid a total loss in a data breach.
